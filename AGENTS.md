- Always read README.md before starting a task.
- Always include tests for new code.
- Always use RGR, even for smaller changes. Write tests first. Confirm they fail. Write the code to make them pass. Confirm they pass.
- Use `mise` for all build, test, etc. commands.
- Always run `mise run check` when you're done.
- Use `mint` for all task tracking and issue management. Run `mint -h` to see all available commands.
- Use `jj`, not `git`, for all git commands.
