    - When listing all issues, we should highlight the part of the issue that is uniquely identifying, i.e. the part of the ID that the user would need to type to uniquely identify the issue. If there are two issues, mt-8a9jfnd and mt-8afj0qn, then mt-8a9 and mt-8af are enough to uniquely identify them. We should figure that out and highlight that part of the issue.

    - We highlight the unique part of an ID when listing the IDs, but when we print an ID (such as when it's created), we should also highlight the unique part of the ID.

    title: "SetPrefix bug: drops first nanoid character when old prefix includes hyphen"
    status: open
    comments:
    - "Bug in store.go:238 - SetPrefix function has 'suffix := oldID[len(oldPrefix)+1:]' which adds +1 to skip the hyphen separator. When old prefix was 'mt-' (included hyphen), this skipped 4 chars instead of 3, dropping first nanoid char. Example: 'mt-0ncc1dk' became 'mint-ncc1dk' (lost '0'). Affected issues: mint-3zpw65, mint-5zdpgt, mint-6yx9is, mint-ab8q1f, mint-an7no0, mint-mfv0us, mint-ncc1dk, mint-oz4u20, mint-piyjpq, mint-rn8qjx, mint-ufovp7, mint-vvjkxz. All have 6-char nanoids instead of 7. Newer issues (jlv9eob, l38ut0u, etc.) created after commit 6de96ff are correct with 7 chars."
