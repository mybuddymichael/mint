    status: closed
    blocks:
    - wjigoz
    comments:
    - When listing all issues, we should highlight the part of the issue that is uniquely identifying, i.e. the part of the ID that the user would need to type to uniquely identify the issue. If there are two issues, mt-8a9jfnd and mt-8afj0qn, then mt-8a9 and mt-8af are enough to uniquely identify them. We should figure that out and highlight that part of the issue.

    - "After fixing the show command crash on stale refs, audit the entire codebase to find other places where stale relationship references might cause issues.\n\nCheck:\n- Update command (does it validate refs before adding?)\n- Other display contexts beyond show\n- Any other operations that iterate through relationships\n- Consider whether we should validate/clean stale refs on store load\n\nThis is a follow-up to ensure comprehensive handling across all commands."

    comments:
    - Right now, every line is printed individually, And every call to print line is checked for an error. Ideally, we would only need to check for an error once, maybe by creating a string and then printing it all together.

    comments:
    - "Implemented dynamic ID length calculation using birthday paradox formula. IDs now start at 3 chars minimum and grow based on issue count (0.1% collision probability): 0-9 issues=3 chars, 10-49=4 chars, 50-99=5 chars, etc. Changes: Added CalculateIDLength() in id.go, updated GenerateID() signature, modified store.go AddIssue(), added comprehensive tests."

    comments:
    - "Running `mint show u8` crashes with 'issue mint-l not found'. Issue u8jkhre has stale dependency ref to non-existent 'mint-l'. Root cause: format_issue.go:16-34 calls store.GetIssue() without defensive handling. When referenced issue doesn't exist, crashes instead of gracefully degrading. DeleteIssue() cleanup works correctly; stale ref likely from manual YAML edit."
    - "Closed with reason: Fixed by adding defensive error handling in format_issue.go. Stale relationship references now display as 'ID (not found)' instead of crashing. Added 4 comprehensive tests to prevent regression."

    title: "SetPrefix bug: drops first nanoid character when old prefix includes hyphen"
    status: closed
    comments:
    - "Bug in store.go:238 - SetPrefix function has 'suffix := oldID[len(oldPrefix)+1:]' which adds +1 to skip the hyphen separator. When old prefix was 'mt-' (included hyphen), this skipped 4 chars instead of 3, dropping first nanoid char. Example: 'mt-0ncc1dk' became 'mint-ncc1dk' (lost '0'). Affected issues: mint-3zpw65, mint-5zdpgt, mint-6yx9is, mint-ab8q1f, mint-an7no0, mint-mfv0us, mint-ncc1dk, mint-oz4u20, mint-piyjpq, mint-rn8qjx, mint-ufovp7, mint-vvjkxz. All have 6-char nanoids instead of 7. Newer issues (jlv9eob, l38ut0u, etc.) created after commit 6de96ff are correct with 7 chars."
    - Fixed in store.go:239 by changing 'suffix := oldID[len(oldPrefix)+1:]' to 'suffix := strings.TrimPrefix(oldID[len(oldPrefix):], "-")'. This handles both prefixes with and without trailing hyphens. Added regression test TestStoreSetPrefix_OldPrefixWithHyphen to prevent future occurrences.
