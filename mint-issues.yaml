    comments:
    - When listing all issues, we should highlight the part of the issue that is uniquely identifying, i.e. the part of the ID that the user would need to type to uniquely identify the issue. If there are two issues, mt-8a9jfnd and mt-8afj0qn, then mt-8a9 and mt-8af are enough to uniquely identify them. We should figure that out and highlight that part of the issue.

    comments:
    - We should add single-letter versions of the various flags to the update command to make it a little bit easier to type out by hand.

    title: Calculate ID length dynamically based on issue count
    status: closed
    comments:
    - "Implemented dynamic ID length calculation using birthday paradox formula. IDs now start at 3 chars minimum and grow based on issue count (0.1% collision probability): 0-9 issues=3 chars, 10-49=4 chars, 50-99=5 chars, etc. Changes: Added CalculateIDLength() in id.go, updated GenerateID() signature, modified store.go AddIssue(), added comprehensive tests."

    - We highlight the unique part of an ID when listing the IDs, but when we print an ID (such as when it's created), we should also highlight the unique part of the ID.

    title: "SetPrefix bug: drops first nanoid character when old prefix includes hyphen"
    status: closed
    comments:
    - "Bug in store.go:238 - SetPrefix function has 'suffix := oldID[len(oldPrefix)+1:]' which adds +1 to skip the hyphen separator. When old prefix was 'mt-' (included hyphen), this skipped 4 chars instead of 3, dropping first nanoid char. Example: 'mt-0ncc1dk' became 'mint-ncc1dk' (lost '0'). Affected issues: mint-3zpw65, mint-5zdpgt, mint-6yx9is, mint-ab8q1f, mint-an7no0, mint-mfv0us, mint-ncc1dk, mint-oz4u20, mint-piyjpq, mint-rn8qjx, mint-ufovp7, mint-vvjkxz. All have 6-char nanoids instead of 7. Newer issues (jlv9eob, l38ut0u, etc.) created after commit 6de96ff are correct with 7 chars."
    - Fixed in store.go:239 by changing 'suffix := oldID[len(oldPrefix)+1:]' to 'suffix := strings.TrimPrefix(oldID[len(oldPrefix):], "-")'. This handles both prefixes with and without trailing hyphens. Added regression test TestStoreSetPrefix_OldPrefixWithHyphen to prevent future occurrences.
