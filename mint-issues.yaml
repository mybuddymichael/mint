    - Now that we have created at and updated timestamps, we should sort the list of issues differently. For ready and blocked issues, we should sort those by when they were created from newest to oldest. And the list of closed issues we should sort by when they were updated with the most recently updated at the top.

    - When listing all issues, we should highlight the part of the issue that is uniquely identifying, i.e. the part of the ID that the user would need to type to uniquely identify the issue. If there are two issues, mt-8a9jfnd and mt-8afj0qn, then mt-8a9 and mt-8af are enough to uniquely identify them. We should figure that out and highlight that part of the issue.

    - It should also have a -L flag as a flag alias. The limit should apply to each section. So if I pass --limit 10, then in each ready section it would show a maximum of 10 issues.

DeleteIssue() cleanup works correctly; stale ref likely from manual YAML edit."

    - "Bug in store.go:238 - SetPrefix function has 'suffix := oldID[len(oldPrefix)+1:]' which adds +1 to skip the hyphen separator. When old prefix was 'mt-' (included hyphen), this skipped 4 chars instead of 3, dropping first nanoid char. Example: 'mt-0ncc1dk' became 'mint-ncc1dk' (lost '0'). Affected issues: mint-3zpw65, mint-5zdpgt, mint-6yx9is, mint-ab8q1f, mint-an7no0, mint-mfv0us, mint-ncc1dk, mint-oz4u20, mint-piyjpq, mint-rn8qjx, mint-ufovp7, mint-vvjkxz. All have 6-char nanoids instead of 7. Newer issues (jlv9eob, l38ut0u, etc.) created after commit 6de96ff are correct with 7 chars."
    - Fixed in store.go:239 by changing 'suffix := oldID[len(oldPrefix)+1:]' to 'suffix := strings.TrimPrefix(oldID[len(oldPrefix):], "-")'. This handles both prefixes with and without trailing hyphens. Added regression test TestStoreSetPrefix_OldPrefixWithHyphen to prevent future occurrences.
